          With a move to a UX team in Sep '21, I've switched direction as a web
          developer, instead of being a delivery focused front-end engineer, I'm
          working with teams as a <strong>SME</strong> (subject matter expert)
          on UI development and more importantly Web Standards &amp; a11y. As
          well as mentoring junior talent in best practices and sharing my
          extensive experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm working alongside a team of designers servicing their needs for
          developer input / advice but also educating and supporting the
          products the designers work to.
