          In a recent change of plan I've decided to ditch my AWS hosting for
          weestoater &amp; other side projects, in order to focus on getting to
          know the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/"

            Salt Design System
          </a>
          . This is an open-source offering from J.P.Morgan which I am trying to
          get to grips with, after years of using <code>Twitter Bootstrap</code>{" "}
          based design systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          It only supports <strong>React</strong>, so I'm parking my
          experimentations with NextJS for a while, as I wasn't finding a lot of
          time on it to be honest. Instead, I'm concentrating on refactoring out
          the <code>Bootstrap</code> layout of weestoater, for{" "}
          <strong>@salt-ds</strong> instead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like all learning curves there have been some frustrations -
          <strong>picnic</strong> - but that is where I'm finding my biggest
          reward. getting into the challenge of any refactor is interesting,
          adding a different design system into the mix has made it all the more
          enjoyable for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          getting to grips with GridLayout, FlexLayout, FlowLayout and
          StackLayout has really made me appreciate the potential of the design
          system and made me rethink the way I look at content layouts after
          years of <code>css:grid</code> offerings.
        </p>
        <div className="left w5">
          <Engine size={64} />
        </div>
        <p>
          I've also taken the opportunity to introduce <strong>TDD</strong> to
          the process and added Github actions as part of the deployment
          process, having ditched AWS and it's Amplify offering. I like the
          benefits of <code>push</code> and forget deployments of AWS, but why
          pay for the privilege when I already have hosting for my domain...
        </p>
        <div className="right w5">
          <Armchair size={64} />
        </div>
        <p>
          One minor deviation from <strong>PURE salt-ds</strong> is that I've
          added another couple of icon libraries, to make the content on the
          site more interesting. Icons are not as extensive in salt-ds, as say
          the likes of bootstrap. so I've plumped for{" "}
          <a href="https://phosphoricons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Phosphor
          </a>
          .

    </div>
